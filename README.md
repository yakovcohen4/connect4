## Connect Four is a two-player connection board game.

### In this game, the players choose a color (blue, red) and then take turns dropping colored discs into a 7-column, 7-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column.

### The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. If the board fills up before either player achieves four in a row, then the game is a draw.

### In this task I made a game board Conncet Four using (Model-View-Controller).

### The first player will start with the blue color and the second player starts with the red color.

# Have fun!
