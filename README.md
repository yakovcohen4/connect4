# MVC

## Topics

- **(Model-View-Controller)** is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic.

- **Model**
  The model defines what data the app should contain.
- **View**
  The view defines how the app's data should be displayed.
- **Controller**
  The controller contains logic that updates the model and/or view in response to input from the users of the app.
- **Pros and Cons**

## Task

#### EndGoal - Build a game that will implement the MVC format.

- The game will be built without a server - only on the client side (frontEnd)
- The default game we recommend to build is "connect 4".
  [Demo](https://connect-4.org/)
  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)
- You may request to build another game and build it with the approval of one of the teachers
- Please use the code written in the class and the attached resources to get inspired and implement the mvc architecture.
- M for Model - Game's Data
- V for View - Game's display and user interaction.
- C for Controller - Game's logic, receiving messages from the View and changing the Model following the messages.
  After changing the Model return the information to the View in order to present the information in the latest form to the user.
- The board size will be 7X7.
- At this stage of the exercise we would like to see functionality, Please deploy the project to GitHub pages.
- There is no need to keep information about the players other than the color they are playing with.
- A peek into the future - In the near future we will want to connect the front to a server to develop a game that is managed in a healthy way not on the client side
- Please submit a blank project in a new repo to the Classroom when you have finished going through the information sources - so we know you have started working,
- Submit once more when project is ready and uploaded to github pages
  Have fun!
